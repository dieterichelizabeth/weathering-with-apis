# 06 Weathering-With-API's

Challenge 6 Server-Side API: Weather Dashboard

This project is an application (using Javascript, HTML, and CSS) to search for weather data. A user can type a city name into the search bar, and the app will display today's weather, as well as a 5 day forecast. Previous searches are saved under the search bar, and can be used to re-display weather for that city name.
It includes the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities, and `localStorage` to store persistent data.

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Our challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS based on the following criteria-

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

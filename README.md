# 06 Weathering-With-API's

Server-Side API: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

To complete this, I created the HTML and added styling to match the mockup provided. Then created a function using the Open Weather API (hard-coding lat/long) to call for/receive an array of weather data. Using the documentation, I added another API call (to find coordinates based on a city name) and added functionality to the search form, so that a user can type the name of the city they would like to find (removing the hardcoded location). Then, I used the response.json method to capture the data in a variable, to pull specific values for display. I added conditional statements so that, if a user searches for an invalid city, or if the app is unable to connect to the API, the user would be informed through an alert.
